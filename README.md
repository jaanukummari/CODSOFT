# CodSoft Internship Projects

## Overview
This repository contains the projects I completed during my internship at CodSoft. These projects showcase my skills in machine learning and data science, focusing on real-world applications. Below are the details of each project:

### 1. Iris Flower Classification
**Description**: This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements.

**Dataset**: The Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Techniques Used**:
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

**Files**:
- `IrisFlowerClassification.ipynb`

### 2. Sales Prediction
**Description**: This project focuses on predicting product sales by analyzing factors such as advertising expenditure and target audience segmentation. The goal is to help businesses optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

**Techniques Used**:
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Regression Algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests)
- Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²)

**Files**:
- `SalesPrediction.ipynb`

### 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Description**: This project involves building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. It includes preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, handling class imbalance, and training classification algorithms.

**Dataset**: Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.

**Techniques Used**:
- Data Preprocessing and Normalization
- Handling Class Imbalance (Oversampling, Undersampling)
- Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forests)
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Precision-Recall Curve)

**Files**:
- `CreditCardFraudDetection.ipynb`
